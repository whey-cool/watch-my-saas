# Watch My SaaS

An open-source development intelligence API for vibe coders. Plug it into your GitHub repo via webhook, and it tells you what's actually happening with your AI-assisted development — what percentage is AI-generated, whether quality is trending up or down, and it auto-generates a public "building in public" timeline so you never have to write a changelog again.

> **Under construction.** This project is in active development. See the [wiki](https://github.com/whey-cool/watch-my-saas/wiki) for progress.
